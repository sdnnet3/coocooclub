Where did we leave off? adding something to do 2d bar codes?
can we add in a function that generates an auto reply from information?
generate coupon codes?
2d barcode that moves to a page that automatically inputs information?

For the memorandum page:
- generate a page very similar to the home page
- auto upload and convert images to a lower resolution
- no crop feature, maybe setup to do that onto a phone?

Coupons:
- Save the numbers somewhere? Maybe check id to see if a code was used?
- scan the 2d barcode, check with id, ie put in drivers/id number
- Don't include the letter in the id?


Time scripts
- Celery might work?

import the list into django database, execute a firing event for the 2d barcode, put the information into a 
** send information into django to store
- generate csv file, or submit data from within django into mailchimp via a web connect function?
